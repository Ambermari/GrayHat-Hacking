###### Setting up Lab 15 Environment
1. Make sure you have completed all the steps at (https://github.com/GrayHatHacking/GHHv6/tree/main/CloudSetup).
2. Go into the Lab subdirectory and run `build.sh` to start the environment build. It will ask you are sure you want to create resources.
when it does, type in `yes`. <BR>
3. This will create resources that may cost you money. If you want to destroy the lab between uses, 
run `destroy.sh`. Answer `yes` when it asks if you are sure, and the resources will be deleted.
